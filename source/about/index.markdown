{% img /about/images/about.jpg "Me" %}

My name is Kuba Matraszek. I live in [Warsaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw). Last year I received master's degree
at [Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl) of the [Warsaw University of Technology](http://www.pw.edu.pl).
The topic of my MA thesis was "Controlling music synthesis system with hand gestures".

I have been [vegan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism) for a couple of years (and vegetariam for some more). That's
something extremaly important for me. I am also a member of [Otwarte Klatki](http://www.otwarteklatki.pl) society. We are focused
on promoting animal rights.

I work as a Ruby on Rails developer at [Cubiware](http://www.cubiware.com). I am more of a backend guy, not really
capable of doing beautiful looking sites, but -- to be honest -- I hope that it will change slightly. Let's say that I
want to increase my skills in HTML/JS, but do not do frontend stuff too often. ;)

Vegan Geek is a blog dedicated to Linux, programming and vegan food -- three things that I really enjoy. There is really
low chance that I will write about something else. I don't want this place to be a "I'll just put everything that seems
interesting to me here" site. I can't promise I will blog on regular basis, but at least I will try.

You can contact me at [jakub.matraszek@gmail.com](mailto:jakub.matraszek@gmail.com), so just write if you are interested in my
opinion on anything...
